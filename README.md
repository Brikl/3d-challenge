# BrikL 3D Challenge

## Reproduce the scene below using Three.js framework:

![cubes.gif](https://github.com/Brikl/3d-challenge/blob/master/cubes.gif?raw=true)

Please refer to [three.js documentation](https://threejs.org/docs/) for examples on how to get started.

## Instructions:

- You can use vanilla HTML/CSS/JS or any library of your choice.
- Create separated commits for each step/progress of your implementation. One big commit with the full solution is not ideal.
- Write clean code with [separation of concerns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Separation_of_concerns) in mind.

## Requirements:

- Try to create a a scene as close as possible to the gif provided.
- The scene should be always the full width and height of the browser, and also it should adapt if the browser is resized. (No scrolling)
- Provide setup instructions on how to setup the project locally.

## Submission:

Please create a PR in this repository and let us know via email.

## Bonus:

If you are feeling excited about three.js, try to create the extra features below:

- Display other geometric forms of your choice, not only cubes
- Rotate the objects in different directions individually
- Create a input that allow to switch the rotation speed of the objects
- Create a button that allow to random add more geometric forms to the scene

Take your time and have fun!
