## About

This attempt uses vanilla HTML/JS with Three.js framework (three.min.js).
The main file is index.html in the root directory. The project can be run using any web server (which serves index.html and gives access to the js directory).
The setup instructions below rely on using `http-server` from `npx` as a simple http server.

Cubes in the scene will be randomed each time the page is loaded. You can refresh the page to obtain a newly randomed set of cubes.

## Setup Instructions

1. Prepare `npx` as a package runner.
2. `npx http-server <PROJECT> -p <PORT>` where `<PROJECT>` is path of the project directory annd `<PORT>` is the port.
3. Open a web browser on `localhost:<PORT>`
